# Basic Modeling Practise

## Data introduction

Today we are using a bike share data for the basic modeling practise. The introoduction of this data set is accessed through this website: (Seoul Bike Sharing Demand - UCI Machine Learning Repository). To our relieve there is no missing values.

The aim of the project is to predict the rental bike count at each hour of a day based on the weather condition, season, holiday and the hour. Since bike usage is sensitive to weather condition it is presumable that certain weather condition, plus the day condition (weekday/weekend, holiday, etc.) is likely to dictate the bike usage in a particular time of the day.

Let's load some packages and read in the data first:

```{r}
library (tidyverse)
library (dplyr)
Bikeshare <- read_csv ("data//SeoulBikeData.csv")

```

Unexpectedly the first trial to read in data failed. It turned out the file contains some special character that the R does not understand/not encoded by the R-recognizable way. After changing the format manually everything is fine.

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
